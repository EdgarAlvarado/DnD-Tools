A time you made something,"A herd of beastmen are currently stalking a traveler's cart on it's way to Middenland. There are 1d8+2 of them. Soon, they will attack the cart with flaming arrows.

A time you were heroic,"As you stray thru forest you hear a crying child in a distance. As You approach the origin of sound, you see a small child, around 7 years old.

The child stops and begins to cry again...",,"The trees shake and thunder, and part as an ancient 'treeman' steps forth onto the road.

The last Chaos army marched by a hundred years ago."
A time you were powerless,"You come across a huge pillar of rock, roughly rectangular in cross section, that has, judging by the state of the vegetation and earth around the base, very recently arrived here, apparently coming from above and piercing the ground. It appears far too large to be moved by man power alone. At one edge of the interface between earth and pillar you find an arm, apparently attached to a body that must be crushed beneath the bottom of the pillar. Even in death it still clutches a sealed scroll...",,You are walking through the tall grass when you hear the shrieks of a demigryph. One of its legs seems to be tied to a corpse on the ground. It would seem someone was trying to train and capture the beast and failed. His tools are still lying there with him...
A time you were proud of someone,"You approach an empty clearing , and as you near a wide stone tower suddenly coalesces into view in the clearing in front of you. The door opens to a man standing in the doorway (but not crossing the threshold). He looks around and says to himself ""Another 30 years already!""

As your character leans towards the soft mound under his feet, an emaciated hand shoots out of the ground."
Are you a dog person or a cat person?,,,A band of 1d5+5 wide-eyed flagellants in filthy brown robes and with wild unkempt hair and beards are following a forest trail that intersects the Character's path.
