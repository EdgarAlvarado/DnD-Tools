Friendly Social,"You come across a huge pillar of rock, roughly rectangular in cross section, that has, judging by the state of the vegetation and earth around the base, very recently arrived here, apparently coming from above and piercing the ground. It appears far too large to be moved by man power alone. At one edge of the interface between earth and pillar you find an arm, apparently attached to a body that must be crushed beneath the bottom of the pillar.

Their raucous cheering and focus on the small battle could allow you sneak up on them, go past them... or set up an ambush."
Hostile Social,"The trees shake and thunder, and part as an ancient 'treeman' steps forth onto the road.

The last Chaos army marched by a hundred years ago."

Hostile Social,"As you walk through the Forest, the dirt under your feet becomes softer. As your character inspects the area, he finds a spade leaning agains a tree. Something was burried here. Is it a treasure or have you discovered a crime scene? As your character leans towards the soft mound under his feet, an emaciated hand shoots out of the ground."
Hostile Social,A band of 1d5+5 wide-eyed flagellants in filthy brown robes and with wild unkempt hair and beards are following a forest trail that intersects the Character's path.

Refusal is greeted with weeping and gnashing of teeth.
