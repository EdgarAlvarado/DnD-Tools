# DnD-Tools
This repo is a small collection of tools that I created to make being a dungeon master a bit easier

It currently contains two tools. One that Simulates dice rolls that you can use by just writing dice notation
IE 2d4, 6d8 etc. 
It can be used for any amount of dice and any number sided die, even ones that dont actually exist like a d18 or a d5


the other tool is a days worth of travel encounter generator based off of giffyglyphs darker dungeons. 
That tool needs a tiny bit of editing to make it work for your campaign. 
You need python with <strong>pandas</strong> to get it to work.
To make character encounters work for your character, you need to change the character.csv file
